## Local installation
To run the website locally, make sure you have installed the `jekyll` and `bundle` gems:
```

```
To prepare the build environment, run:
```
bundle install
```
To build the site and make it available on a local server, change directory to the root of the repository and run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve

Then, point your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Adding a post
You can add a post by creating a file in the `_posts` directory.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

Make sure the file has a proper header of the following form:
```

---
```
The `-0800` timezone parameter denotes PST.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
