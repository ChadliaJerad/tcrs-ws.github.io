We are excited to announce the third iteration of the workshop on Time-Centric Reactive
Software (TCRS), now co-located with Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK) 2025. This full-day
workshop will be held either on October 3 or on October 2, 2025, in Taipei, Taiwan. TCRS
addresses the critical role of timing in concurrent, distributed, and cyber-physical
systems, all of which are key focus areas of the ESWEEK community. It aims to highlight
and discuss innovative work that prioritizes timing in programming paradigms, languages,
and hardware-software interfaces, showcasing advancements in programming languages and
models for timed systems. The objective of this workshop is to foster an exchange of
insights, identification key challenges and opportunities, and evaluation of a broad
range of methodologies and strategies related to achieving timed behavior in computer
systems.
