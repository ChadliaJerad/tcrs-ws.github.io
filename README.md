# Website for TCRS '23

To contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Notes for future editions
For websites for future editions of TCRS, take the following steps:
1. Fork off a new repository from `acm-ws.github.io` and call it `YYYY` where `YYYY` denotes the year of previous year's workshop.
The current website should remain available at [tcrs-ws.github.io](https://tcrs-ws.github.io/) while the old website will be available at [tcrs-ws.github.io/YYYY](https://tcrs-ws.github.io/YYYY).
2. You can now update the `acm-ws.github.io` repo to show information about the upcoming workshop. (Remember to add a link to the old website.)
3. (**Recommended**) Archive the old repo (see [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories)).
