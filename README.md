# Website for TCRS '23

To contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Notes for future editions
For websites for future editions of TCRS, take the following steps:
1. Fork off a new repository from `acm-tcrs.github.io` and call it `tcrsXX` where `XX` denotes the year of the upcoming workshop.
2. Edit the contents. Once the new website is ready to go live, navigate to the GitHub page of `acm-tcrs.github.io`,
go to `Settings->General` and rename it to `tcrsYY` where `YY` denotes the year of past year's workshop.
3. Now navigate to the GitHub page of the new `tcrsXX` repo,
go to `Settings->General` and rename it to `acm-tcrs.github.io`.
The new website should now be available at [acm-tcrs.github.io](https://acm-tcrs.github.io/) while the old website will be available at [acm-tcrs.github.io/tcrsYY](https://acm-tcrs.github.io/tcrsYY).
4. (**Recommended**) Archive the old repo (see [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories)).
