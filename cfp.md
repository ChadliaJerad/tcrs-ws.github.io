## Submissions
This year's TCRS will work with IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL), special issue TCRS.
All submissions must be in English. 
and not exceed **4 pages**. The page limit includes title page, references, and appendices.
The review process is **blind** (not double-blind); please do not submit anonymized manuscripts.

### Acceptance Tiers
At least one of the authors is expected to fully register and present the accepted paper at the workshop.
As this year's TCRS will work with IEEE ESL, we will have two tiers of final acceptance.
1. Publication-and-Workshop-presentation acceptance.
2. Workshop-presentation acceptance.
The Workshop-presentation tier acceptance will be given to the submissions that meet the TCRS workshop quality requirements.
The Publication-and-Workshop-presentation tier acceptance will be given to the submissions that meet the quality requirements for IEEE ELS journal publication as well as the quality requirements for the TCRS workshop.

All papers with any of these two tiers of acceptance will be presented at the workshop, and distributed as proceedings of the workshop. However, only the papers with the Publication-and-Workshop-presentation tier acceptance will be publisehd in IEEE ESL special issue.

### Review Process
Authors of the submissions will be notified with the first round of reviews. The results will be one of the following.

- Authors of the submssions with Workshop-presentation acceptance will be asked to submit the final PDFs that will be included in the proceedings to distribute.

- Authors of the submissions with Publication-and-Workshop-presentation acceptance will receive an "accept" or "minor revision" decision from IEEE ESL and will be required to submit the final PDF and 1-minute video presentation.
Both the final PDF manuscript and the 1-minute vidoe presentation will be publisehd by IEEE ESL.
