## Submissions
TCRS '24 will work with [IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL)](https://ieee-ceda.org/publication/esl) for paper submission, reviews, and publication.
Submissions meeting IEEE ESL requirements will be published in the special issue of TCRS in IEEE ESL.
All submissions must be written in English. 
Only original papers that have not been submitted or published in other conferences or journals will be considered.

### Submission Guidelines
Papers submitted to TCRS '24 must follow the [IEEE ESL Paper Submission Instructions](https://ieee-ceda.org/publication/esl/esl-paper-submission).
Submitted manuscripts must be **four pages or fewer**, including all figures, tables, and references.
The review process is **blind** (not double-blind);
please do not submit anonymized manuscripts.

### Submission site
Please submit your paper at the [Submission Site for
Embedded Systems Letters](https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/les-ieee).
Click on "**Author**," create a new manuscript, and select "**Type**" as "**SI:TCRS24**".

### Acceptance Tiers
At least one of the authors for each paper must fully register and present the accepted paper at the workshop.
TCRS '24 will have two tiers of final acceptance.

1. *Workshop-presentation* acceptance.
2. *Publication-and-Workshop-presentation* acceptance.

The *Workshop-presentation* tier acceptance will be given to the submissions that meet the TCRS workshop quality requirements.
The *Publication-and-Workshop-presentation* tier acceptance will be given to the submissions that meet the quality requirements for IEEE ELS journal publication as well as the quality requirements for the TCRS workshop.

All papers with any of these two tiers of acceptance will be presented at the workshop and distributed as proceedings of the workshop.
However, only the papers with the *Publication-and-Workshop-presentation* tier acceptance will be publisehd in IEEE ESL special issue of TCRS.

### Review Process
Authors of the submissions will be notified with the first round of reviews.
Below are the subsequent processes for accepted papers.

1. Authors of the submissions with *Workshop-presentation* acceptance will be asked to submit the final PDFs that will be included in the "*proceedings to distribute*".
The review result from IEEE ESL will be a "reject" for the submission with *Workshop-presentation* acceptance; however, the authors will receive separate notices for *Workshop-presentation* acceptance.

2. Authors of the submissions with *Publication-and-Workshop-presentation* acceptance will receive a "minor revision" decision from IEEE ESL and will be required to submit the final PDF and a video graphical abstract, a short video presenting the paper.
Both the final PDF manuscript and the video graphical abstract will be published by IEEE ESL.
See [here](https://ieee-ceda.org/publication/esl/esl-paper-submission) for more information on the video graphical abstract.

Final submissions with *Publication-and-Workshop-presentation* acceptance, including both the final camera-ready PDF and the video graphical abstract, will be reviewed in the second round.
Once the camera-ready PDF and the video graphical abstract are reviewed and meet IEEE ESL standards, the manuscript submission will receive an "accept" decision and be included in the IEEE ESL special issue of TCRS.
