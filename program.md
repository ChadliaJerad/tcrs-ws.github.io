<b>Jonathan Sprinkle</b> is a Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. Prior to joining Vanderbilt in 2021, he was the Litton Industries John M. Leonis Distinguished Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona, and the Interim Director of the Transportation Research Institute. In 2020 he was named a Distinguished Scholar of the University of Arizona. From 2017-2019 he served as a Program Director in Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart & Connected Communities at the National Science Foundation in the CISE Directorate. In 2013 he received the NSF CAREER award, and in 2009, he received the UA's Ed and Joan Biggers Faculty Support Grant for work in autonomous systems. His work has an emphasis for industry impact, and he was recognized with the UA "Catapult Award" by Tech Launch Arizona in 2014, and in 2012 his team won the NSF I-Corps Best Team award. His research interests and experience are in model-based approaches to cyber-physical systems, and he teaches courses ranging from systems modeling and control to mobile application development and software engineering.

<b>Abstract</b>–This talk describes the deployment of research-quality software and hardware for open-road driving experiments by fleets of vehicles. Technological advancements in single-vehicle autonomy have expanded beyond the academic community, and are driven largely by industry stakeholders and manufacturers. However, as the penetration rate of cars with advanced driver assistance features increases, the impact on emergent behavior in traffic is still unknown. Compelling reasons to experiment within open-road conditions must be considered alongside the technical and human factor safety issues in deploying experimental controllers. This is even more challenging when it is necessary to deploy experimental fleets at scale. The talk will describe approaches for co-design of a research testbed for societal-scale systems. Discussion is devoted to the research-quality data gathering and control layers and their technical implementation, the different interfaces for experts in other fields to use these testbeds for research without violating safety requirements, and process and management considerations when deploying the platforms at scale when considering training time and operation complexity of human operators.
