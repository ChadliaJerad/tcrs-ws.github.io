TCRS '23 will take place on May 9 on the main campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).
Details about the exact location will follow.

## Session 1 (Keynote)
**9:00-10:00am**
 - **Safety First: Though on the Other Hand, Time is Critical**, Jonathan Sprinkle
<div style="text-align: justify">
<b>Abstract</b>â€“This talk describes the deployment of research-quality software and hardware for open-road driving experiments by fleets of vehicles. Technological advancements in single-vehicle autonomy have expanded beyond the academic community, and are driven largely by industry stakeholders and manufacturers. However, as the penetration rate of cars with advanced driver assistance features increases, the impact on emergent behavior in traffic is still unknown. Compelling reasons to experiment within open-road conditions must be considered alongside the technical and human factor safety issues in deploying experimental controllers. This is even more challenging when it is necessary to deploy experimental fleets at scale. The talk will describe approaches for co-design of a research testbed for societal-scale systems. Discussion is devoted to the research-quality data gathering and control layers and their technical implementation, the different interfaces for experts in other fields to use these testbeds for research without violating safety requirements, and process and management considerations when deploying the platforms at scale when considering training time and operation complexity of human operators.
